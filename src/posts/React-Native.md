So far, React native has been a fun learning experience for me. I wasn't sure how different it was going to be from regular React, and I'm glad to find out it's really not that different. There are some differences, but they're really not difficult to pick up. For example, routing is a bit different from using react-router, but it's pretty similar and easy to do. Learning about React native feels like I just opened up a new world to explore and create with. I'm really excited to jump further into it and start making my own mobile apps.
