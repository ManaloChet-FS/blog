Learning Next.js has been a great experience. I've done a multitude of tutorials and looked at the documentation a few times. I'm having a bit of trouble with things but I think I'm starting to really get the hang of it. I've already made a couple of websites utilizing Next and I am pretty proud of them. I'll write another post about the websites that I've made with Next and the progress I'm making on projects.
