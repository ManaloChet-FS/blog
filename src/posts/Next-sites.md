I've made a few sites in Next that were based on tutorials, but right now, I want to talk about the site I made myself. The first site I made with Next, was for a local dumpster rental business called Honorable Discharge Dumpsters. They provided me with images, wording, and other things they wanted on the site, I made the design in Figma and translated it into an actual site using Next.js. During development, I ran into many issues, but I was able to solve them using the Next docs and information from other developers. In the end, I finished the site and the client was very happy with it.
