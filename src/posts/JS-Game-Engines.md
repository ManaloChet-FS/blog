There are quite a few JS game engines out there like PhaserJS, melonJS, and PixiJS. Recently, I got a bit of experience with Pixi due to it being a part of an assignment from a previous class. It seemed pretty simple to use and relatively easy to pick up, but I want to explore all the available options. Phaser seems pretty popular as I've heard people talk about it before and it seems to always come up when the topic of JS game engines comes up. Whatever engine I decide to pursue, my ultimate goal of creating a fun game, will not change, so I just need to find the engine that best suits my needs.
